features:
  - Add instance_discovery_method to ceilometer agent compute and polling
    classes so this option is configurable.
upgrade:
  - When upgrading, ensure that you dont have both the agent compute as well
    as the polling classes initialized as that would trigger a duplicate
    declaration. Ceilometer::agent::compute is deprecated and will be removed
    in pike release.
