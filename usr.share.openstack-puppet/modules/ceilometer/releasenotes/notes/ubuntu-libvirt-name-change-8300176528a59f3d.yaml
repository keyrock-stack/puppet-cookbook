  - |
    The group for libvirt has changed for the polling and compute agent and
    the module now expects the Debian specific naming conventions which are
    supplied in libvirt-bin 2.5.0.
fixes:
  - |
    The libvirt group name for the polling and compute agents is now 'libvirt'
    on Ubuntu. If trying to use the Ocata module with previous packages, you
    may run into issues around the group name.
