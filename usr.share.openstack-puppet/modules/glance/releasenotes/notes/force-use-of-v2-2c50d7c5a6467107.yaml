    Glance API v1 is now deprecated and tools depending on it should move onto
    as their default, and perhaps only supported, version.

    This change deprecates the use of v1 (by forcing v2). This assumes the
    Glance service it will talk to has v2 enabled. In order to guarantee
    compatibility, this changes introduces a similar, fake, copy-from behavior
    which downloads the remote image into the server (a temporary file) where
    the provider is running and then uploads it to Glance. Consumers of this
    provider must be aware of space limitations and the possibility of there not
    being enough space for this operation to succeed.
