# Resource to serve Heat API with apache mod_wsgi in place of heat-api service.
#
# This is useful for the main API as well as the CFN and Cloudwatch APIs.
# Serving Heat API from apache is the recommended way to go for production
# because of limited performance for concurrent accesses when running eventlet.
#
# When using this class you should disable your heat-api service.
#
# == Parameters
#
#   [*title*]
#     The heat API that will be running over this vhost.
#     The valid options are "api", "api_cfn" and "api_cloudwatch"
#
#   [*port*]
#     The port for the specific API.
#
#   [*servername*]
#     The servername for the virtualhost.
#     Optional. Defaults to $::fqdn
#
#   [*bind_host*]
#     The host/ip address Apache will listen on.
#     Optional. Defaults to undef (listen on all ip addresses).
#
#   [*path*]
#     The prefix for the endpoint.
#     Optional. Defaults to '/'
#
#   [*ssl*]
#     Use ssl ? (boolean)
#     Optional. Defaults to true
#
#   [*workers*]
#     Number of WSGI workers to spawn.
#     Optional. Defaults to 1
#
#   [*priority*]
#     (optional) The priority for the vhost.
#     Defaults to '10'
#
#   [*threads*]
#     (optional) The number of threads for the vhost.
#     Defaults to $::os_workers
#
#   [*ssl_cert*]
#   [*ssl_key*]
#   [*ssl_chain*]
#   [*ssl_ca*]
#   [*ssl_crl_path*]
#   [*ssl_crl*]
#   [*ssl_certs_dir*]
#     apache::vhost ssl parameters.
#     Optional. Default to apache::vhost 'ssl_*' defaults.
#
#   [*vhost_custom_fragment*]
#     (optional) Additional vhost configuration, if applicable.
