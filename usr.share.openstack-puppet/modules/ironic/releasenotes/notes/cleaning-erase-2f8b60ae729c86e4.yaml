      Add new option ``ironic::conductor::cleaning_disk_erase`` for tweaking
      how Ironic erases hard drive during cleaning. Possible values:

      * *full* - erase all data on all hard drives using either ATA secure
        erase or ``shred`` utility.

      * *metadata* - erase only disk metadata on all hard drives, leaving
        data intact.

      * *none* - do not erase anything (only use it if you have other means
        of erasing hard drives in place).

    - Add new option ``ironic::conductor::continue_if_disk_secure_erase_fails``
      which defines whether ironic should fall back to ``shred`` utility
      if ATA secure erase is available, but fails in the process.
