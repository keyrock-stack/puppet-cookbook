    New manifest "ironic::drivers::inspector" to set parameters for connecting
    from ironic to to ironic-inspector.
    Please set credentials for ironic to access ironic-inspector using this
    manifest, otherwise ironic falls back to using "keystone_authtoken"
    credentials, which are deprecated for this purpose.

    Also allows configuring "enabled" and "service_url" parameters.
