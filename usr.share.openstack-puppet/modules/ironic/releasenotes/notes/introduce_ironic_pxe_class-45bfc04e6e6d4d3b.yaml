features:
  - Introduced ironic::pxe class to fully setup tftpboot
    and httpboot for Ironic and ironic::pxe::common to
    allow global overrides of options shared among
    standalone classes ironic::inspector, ironic::pxe
    and ironic::drivers::pxe.
upgrade:
  - The ironic::inspector class will no longer provide
    tftp_root and http_root paths. These are provided
    by ironic::pxe class and the inclusion of this
    class will be removed after Newton cycle. Either
    create tftp_root and http_root or include ironic::pxe
    for full PXE setup.
