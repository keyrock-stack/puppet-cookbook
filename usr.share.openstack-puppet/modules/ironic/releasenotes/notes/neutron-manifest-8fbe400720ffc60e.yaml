    New manifest "ironic::neutron" to set parameters for connecting to neutron.
    Please set credentials for ironic to access neutron using this manifest,
    otherwise ironic falls back to using "keystone_authtoken" credentials,
    which are deprecated for this purpose.
deprecations:
  - |
    Parameter "ironic::api::neutron_url" is deprecated, use
    "ironic::neutron::api_endpoint" instead.
upgrade:
  - |
    Value of "ironic::neutron::api_endpoint" parameter (former
    "ironic::api::neutron_url") was reset to the service default. The default
    of "127.0.0.1:9696" was often wrong, without it ironic will fetch the
    corrent one from the service catalog.
