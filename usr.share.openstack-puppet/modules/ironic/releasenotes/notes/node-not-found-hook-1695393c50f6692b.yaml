features:
  - New parameter "node_not_found_hook" allows configuring ironic-inspector
    plugin to run when a node is not found during lookup. For example,
    "enroll" hook implements node auto-discovery.
  - New parameter "discovery_default_driver" allows configuring the default
    driver to be set by ironic-inspector for newly discovered nodes, when
    "node_not_found_hook" is set to "enroll".
