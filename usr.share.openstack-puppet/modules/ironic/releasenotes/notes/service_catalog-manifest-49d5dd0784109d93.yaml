    New manifest "ironic::service_catalog" to set parameters for connecting to
    the service catalog (used to fetch the ironic internal API URL)
    Please set credentials for ironic to access the service catalog using this
    manifest, otherwise ironic falls back to using "keystone_authtoken"
    credentials, which are deprecated for this purpose.
