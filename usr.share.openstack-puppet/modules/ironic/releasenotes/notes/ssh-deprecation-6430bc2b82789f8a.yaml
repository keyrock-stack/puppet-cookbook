deprecations:
  - |
    The ``*_ssh`` family of drivers was deprecated in Ironic in the Newton
    release and will be completely removed in Pike. The
    ``ironic::drivers::ssh`` manifest is also deprecated now, will become
    noop in Pike, and will be removed in Queens.

    Please switch to ``*_ipmitool`` family of drivers with ``virtualbmc``
    for virtual testing.
