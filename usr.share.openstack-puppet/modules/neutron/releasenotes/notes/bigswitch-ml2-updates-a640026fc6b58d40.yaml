features:
  - |
    Added additional configuration parameters for the bigswitch restproxy
    plugin configuration. Added the ability to configure `cache_connections`,
    `keystone_sync_interval`, `no_Ssl_validation, `server_timeout`,
    `sync_data`, and `thread_pool_size`
upgrade:
  - |
    Switched the bigswitch restproxy configuration to use $::os_service_default
    for parameters that match the upstream default. It should be noted that
    the default values for `ssl_cert_directory` and `neutron_id` do not match
    the defaults from the networking-bigswitch classes and have been left alone.
