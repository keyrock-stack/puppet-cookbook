fixes:
  - Parameters of type dict must be at the end of the
    shell command to not cause conflict with the network name.
    Neutron cli picks up the network name as the first parameter
    without "--" prefix, thus tresting type=dict as the network
    name instead of the real network name because it comes before.
    By providing the special dictionary type commands after the
    network name the behaviour of the cli is bypassed and neutron
    takes the network name and proceeds interpreting parameters
    with special format ( not in the form of --<param>=<value> )
