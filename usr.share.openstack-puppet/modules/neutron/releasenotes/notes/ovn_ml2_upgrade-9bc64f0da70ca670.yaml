upgrade:
  - Previously OVN plugin for Neutron used to be a core plugin. With
    the recent changes in networking-ovn project, OVN is plugged in to
    neutron as an ml2 mechanism driver.

deprecations:
  - neutron::plugins::ovn is deprecated as it was managing OVN as a 
    core-plugin. This is deprecated in favor of its ml2 equivalent
    neutron::plugins::ml2::ovn
