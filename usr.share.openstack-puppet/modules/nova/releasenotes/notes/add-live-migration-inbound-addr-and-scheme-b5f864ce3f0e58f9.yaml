features:
  - The paremeter 'live_migration_inbound_addr' was introduced to the libvirt
    live migration module. This sets the configuration option with the same
    name in the nova configuration, in the 'libvirt' section.
  - If TLS is enabled for libvirt's live migration, the module will set the
    configuration option named 'live_migration_scheme' in the 'libvirt' section
    to have the value 'tls'. This will be used by nova to form the scheme for
    the live migration URI, e.g. 'qemu+tls://...'.
  - Note that the usage of 'live_migratin_inbound_addr' doesn't permit adding
    extra parameters to the live migration URI as of the writing of this.
