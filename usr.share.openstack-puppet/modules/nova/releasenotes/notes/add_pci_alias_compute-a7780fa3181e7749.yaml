fixes:
  - |
    [pci]/alias option is now required in the nova configuration file on compute nodes too.
    This requires refactoring of the manifests as the parameter is common to nova::compute
    and nova::api.
    Common pci configuration is now done by the nova::pci class while compute specific
    configuration is done now by the nova::compute::pci class.
deprecations:
  - |
    nova::api::pci_alias is deprecated by nova::pci::aliases
    nova::compute::pci_passthrough is deprecated by nova::compute::pci::passthrough
