    Adds the ability to perform a simple cell v2 setup using map_cell0,
    create_cell and discover_hosts via nova::cell_v2::simple_setup.
upgrade:
  - |
    Cell v2 must be setup prior to upgrading to Ocata or the db api sync will
    fail. If upgrading from from an evironment with existing compute nodes and
    planning to use puppet to manage your hosts, DO NOT use the
    'nova-manage cell_v2 cell_simple_setup' and nova::cell_v2::simple_setup as
    they will clash on the default cell management.
