upgrade:
  - The default value for nova::compute::libvirt::libvirt_cpu_mode
    when nova::compute::libvirt::libvirt_virt_type is set to 'qemu'
    has been changed from 'host-model' to 'none'. The Nova gate
    does not really test the 'host-model' option in their CI, but
    'none' due to Devstack configuration, and it is known to create
    issues with QEMU 2.6 (see 
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1404627).
