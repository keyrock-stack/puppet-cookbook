features:
  - Enable puppet-nova to deploy micro-services where libvirt & nova-compute
    are separated. With a new class, nova::compute::libvirt::services, we're now
    able to manage libvirt packages & services outside nova-compute.
    This class is included by default in nova::compute::libvirt for backward
    compatibility but can be disabled if you deploy compute services on containers.
