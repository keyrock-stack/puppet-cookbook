    novncproxy_base_url parameter is only consumed by nova-compute. Thus it should
    not be configured on controller node, where novnc proxy service runs. In packstack
    deployment it causes problem when controller and compute are configured on the
    same node and novncproxy_base_url is set to `http://0.0.0.0:6080/vnc_auto.html`.
    In this case nova will return incorrect novnc url for instances, that run on such
    compute node.
