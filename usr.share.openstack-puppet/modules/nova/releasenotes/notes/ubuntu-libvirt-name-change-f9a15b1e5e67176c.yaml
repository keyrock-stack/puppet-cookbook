    Ubuntu updated their libvirt package to 2.5.0 which uses the Debian name
    for libvirtd configurations and services. The module has been updated to
    use the new naming conventions for the configuration files.  If using the
    Ocata module with the Newton packages, be aware that the configuration
    of the default files may not work correctly.
