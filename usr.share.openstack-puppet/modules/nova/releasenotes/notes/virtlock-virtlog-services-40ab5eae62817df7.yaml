fixes:
  - Manage virtlockd and virtlogd services as part of
    the nova::compute::libvirt as they are needed for
    nova. The virtlockd service is currently managed
    for RedHat and Ubuntu but skipped under Debian.
    The virtlogd service is Ubuntu specific but can
    be managed if the virtlog_service_name is provided
    to the nova::compute::libvirt class.
