features:
  - A new ceilometermiddleware option "nonblocking_notify" has been
    added and can be used to send notifications in a separate background
    thread. This avoids blocking of Swift if RabbitMQ is not able to
    process new notifications. In this case notifications will be
    dropped after the local queue (defaults to 1000 entries) is
    exhausted. It requires the Newton release of ceilometermiddleware.
    This option is disabled by default and not changing the current
    behavior.
