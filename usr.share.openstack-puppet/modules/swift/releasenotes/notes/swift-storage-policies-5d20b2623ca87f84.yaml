    Add support for swift storage policies.
    This change adds storage policy support to the
    swift ringbuilder class as well as ring_object_device.
    This change also adds a new custom type/provider
    called swift_storage_policy that is used to create
    and enforce rules for storage policies in swift.conf
features:
  - Add support for swift storage policies.
    This change adds storage policy support to the
    swift ringbuilder class as well as ring_object_device.
    The swift ringbuilder provider was modified to accept
    ring_object_device with a name that starts with an
    integer followed by colon.  For example, a ring_object_device
    without a storage policy would be named 127.0.0.1:6000/4
    A ring_object_device that should be included in
    storage-policy:1 would be 1:127.0.0.1:6000/4.
    Spec tests were split up and updated to test the
    changes to ring_object_device as well.
  - This change also adds a new custom type/provider
    called swift_storage_policy that is used to create
    and enforce rules for storage policies in swift.conf
    This provider enforces rules established by the swift
    project for storage_policies.  This provider uses the
    puppet inifile provider to control storage policy
    entries in swift.conf.  This provider implements a way
    to remove/purge a storage policy including it's section
    header from swift.conf.
  - An upcoming change will enable the use of erasure code
    through swift storage policies.
upgrade:
  - No action is required by existing users of this
    module.  To begin using storage policies follow the
    example upgrade procedure in the README under the
    swift storage policy section.
